<h1>Kindle in Motion</h1>
<h3 class="date">Jun 2016 – now</h3>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-in-Motion/b?ie=UTF8&node=14530743011">Kindle in Motion</a> is a recent Amazon initiative to enhance ebooks further than before. The new format features full-edge bleed for visual assets, page textures, reflowable text, irregular text wraps, and more. KiM launched with a mix of live-action and illustrated books at the end of summer 2016, and has since branched out into nonfiction while doubling the number of available books.</p>
<h2>My role</h2>
<h3>Digital Content Specialist turned to UX Designer</h3>
<p>As a Digital Content Specialist, I worked on a small team dedicated to the production and development of KiM titles. We initially focused on perfecting the 2016 launch titles, making sure that the design worked on a variety of handheld devices. This involved paging through a build, logging bugs, and iterating on the base InDesign file before starting the QA process again.</p>
<p>As KiM production moved to a different team, my role shifted to design-heavy work. With the success our initial titles had, more publishers and authors were interested in creating KiM versions of their stories. To attain buy-in and show what we could accomplish, I worked on several prototypes for both internal and external review. This involved designing and laying out the books, as well as creating concept art and mockups with provided assets. Current titles are confidential, pending launch.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Keeping it user-focused: One of the tenets I always stuck to throughout the process was “Will this enhance or detract from the reader experience?” With any new format, it’s easy to get lost in showing the new features that are available. Especially with our visual angle, it would be easy to overwhelm readers and detract from the text. Whenever I thought this was happening, I made a case to remove or change assets.</p>
<p>New tools, little documentation: Books were converted to epubs through a new tool written by an internal Amazon team. This cut down on our churn per book significantly, but our team did not have much insight into how the tool worked or what the tool needed to work perfectly each time. This forced us to troubleshoot our base files, the tool itself, and become SMEs on the process.</p>
<p>Proprietary tools and language: As we moved onto more complex and exploratory titles, our tools could not do everything we needed. Instead of wait for our dev teams to respond, I began directly editing epubs (HTML/CSS) to build the desired experience. However, we were constrained by the proprietary abilities of the wider ebook formats, and had to find creative solutions to make our designs work.</p>
