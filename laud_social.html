<h1>Laud Social</h1>
<h3 class="date">Jan 2015 – Apr 2015</h3>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>Laud Social is a tool to automate social media marketing and make maintaining a social presence easier. It was created for small to medium businesses that did not have a dedicated social media manager or ability.</p>
<p>Our goal was to assess the usability of the then-unreleased iPhone app by performing a benchmark study. We designed, conducted, and analyzed the study, then presented it to both the client and our peers. After the course was over, Laud Social enlisted us to perform a follow-up study on the v2 app that incorporated suggestions from our initial findings.</p>
<h2>My role</h2>
<h3>Lead and Moderator</h3>
<p>From the beginning, I acted as the de-facto lead of my four-person team, as well as the main point-of-contact for the client. When we started the participant sessions, I conducted half of the sessions while also taking notes of any feedback. All of us contributed to the design and analysis.</p>
<h2>Benchmark Study</h2>
<p>6 participants (4F, 2M)</p>
<p>10 tasks in three different sections</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Learning iOS: This is a personal challenge, as I had never spent much time with iOS. It took many rounds of clicking around the app to learn what did what, but I felt that I needed to know it in case the participant needed help steering back to a page.</p>
<p>Data synthesis: We wanted to make the study worthwhile to the client, so we designed a comprehensive study with 10 tasks. This meant we had a lot of data to sort and analyze after the fact, a process that took many late nights and cross-checking.</p>
<p>Recording: In order to get a comprehensive understanding of the participant’s app usage, we wanted to record both the physical reactions (facial movements, comments) and the on-screen clicking. To do this, we set up a video camera to record the full scene as well as a Go-Pro on a mobile arm to capture the hand movements.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
