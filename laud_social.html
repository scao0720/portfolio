      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Laud Social is a tool to automate social media marketing and make maintaining a social presence easier. It was created for small to medium businesses that did not have a dedicated social media manager or ability.</p>
        <p>Our goal was to assess the usability of the then-unreleased iPhone app by performing a benchmark study. We designed, conducted, and analyzed the study, then presented it to both the client and our peers. After the course was over, Laud Social enlisted us to perform a follow-up study on the v2 app that incorporated suggestions from our initial findings.</p>
      <h2>My role</h2>
      <img class="img-portfolio" src="images/laud-social_lead.jpg" alt="">
      <h3>Lead and Moderator</h3>
        <p>From the beginning, I acted as the de-facto lead of my four-person team, as well as the main point-of-contact for the client. When we started the participant sessions, I conducted half of the sessions while also taking notes of any feedback. All of us contributed to the design and analysis.</p>
      <h2>Benchmark Study</h2>
        <p>6 participants were asked to perform 10 tasks covering common app tasks. They were asked to use the think aloud protocol, and their actions were observed and recorded.</p>
        <p>Participant breakdown:
          <ul>
            <li>4 female, 2 male</li>
            <li>Between 18 and 60 years of age</li>
            <li>owns and uses iPhone daily</li>
            <li>2 experts, 2 intermediates, and 2 novices in social media marketing</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We reserved a quiet common room of an apartment building for the study, and used a custom-built GoPro stand and video camera to record participants.</p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p><span id="bold">Learning iOS:</span> This is a personal challenge, as I had never spent much time with iOS. It took many rounds of clicking around the app to learn what did what, but I felt that I needed to know it in case the participant needed help steering back to a page.</p>
        <p><span id="bold">Data synthesis:</span> We wanted to make the study worthwhile to the client, so we designed a comprehensive study with 10 tasks. This meant we had a lot of data to sort and analyze after the fact, a process that took many late nights and cross-checking.</p>
        <p><span id="bold">Recording:</span> In order to get a comprehensive understanding of the participantâ€™s app usage, we wanted to record both the physical reactions (facial movements, comments) and the on-screen clicking. To do this, we set up a video camera to record the full scene as well as a Go-Pro on a mobile arm to capture the hand movements.</p>
