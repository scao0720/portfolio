  <!-- WHAT -->
  <div id="the-what" class="col span_1_of_2">
      <p>I'm currently working as a QA and UX Designer on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-in-Motion/b?ie=UTF8&node=14530743011">Kindle in Motion</a>, Amazon's recent ebook format <a href="http://the-digital-reader.com/2016/08/13/kindle-motion-good-bad-ugly-amazons-new-enhanced-format-screenshots/">innovation</a>. We're pushing the bounds of traditional ebooks to give readers a better on-device experience and publishers more features to deliver their content. I strongly value thinking outside of the box, interdisciplinary collaboration, and iterative design (though there's something to be said about getting it "right" the first time!).</p>

<!-- WHY -->
  <div id="the-why" class="col span_1_of_2">
    <p>I've always known I wanted to create. But the what, where, and how changed drastically over time. What initially started as a photography and writing hobby led me to a passion to craft journeys that the user can not only see but evocatively experience - through touch, movement, sound, and more.</p>
  <p>Check out what I'm <a href="work.html">working on now</a>. My current non-work obsessions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning how to play this <a href="https://youtu.be/_4kuQ_T95VY">Adventure Time Medley</a> on the piano</li>
      <li>Clearing a corner of my backyard for a chicken coop</li>
      <li>The return of sunshine to Seattle</li>
      <li>Building an interactive Mario box</li>
