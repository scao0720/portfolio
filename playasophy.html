<h1>Playasophy</h1>
<h3>Jan 2013 – now</h3>
<h2>My Role</h2>
<h3>Lead and Moderator</h3>
<p>My first year, I designed and built my camp’s new Hookah Lounge. I primarily focused on the overall experience, and led the décor effort to create the desert caravan feel. In my second year, I increased our coffee and hookah offerings, as well as our on-Playa visibility. In my third year, I designed and built three laser-cut pillars to improve our camp frontage and overall look and feel. In my fourth year, I helped improved our LED art and wrote documentation on how to run camp to pass on to the new leadership.</p>
<p>Apart from yearly projects, I’ve also co-led the camp since 2014. At a high level, I was in charge of inter-group communications, transportation, scheduling, and people management. I also coordinated the kitchen, our offerings, and acted as the main point-of-contact for inquiries.</p>
<h2>Camp Management</h2>
<p>Running a 35-person camp at Burning Man is not an easy task, and requires a variety of managerial and administrative tasks. Add in the fact that this desert is a hostile environment that most are not used to, and the task now encompasses keeping everyone alive and relatively unharmed. Off-Playa, this means that we maintain documentation on how to run the camp, year-to-year operations, and communication to both the Burning Man organization and to our members.</p>
<h2>Hookah Lounge and Iced Coffee</h2>
<p>This is our main public offering, with the Lounge open five of the seven days that people are on-site. To keep things running smoothly, we require members to work four 2.5-hour shifts throughout the week. Shifts are split into hookah running, coffee making, serving, and bartending.</p>
<p>Previously, I tracked and managed the burn rate of all consumables to ensure we had enough for a full week’s offering. This also led to off-Playa math to figure out how much we need to increase our amount of open hours.</p>
<h2>Camp Frontage and Sign</h2>
<p>While the appeal of iced coffee was strong, the outside of our camp still looked like a bunker and did not show what we truly were. I went through a few different design rounds and settled on pillar boxes to frame the entrance and create a more intriguing look. To do this, I researched laser cutting and construction.</p>
<p>I also helped with creating a new and simpler laser-cut sign to replace our previous one, as it did not work half of the time.</p>
